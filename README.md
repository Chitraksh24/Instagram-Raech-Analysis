 Overview

Instagram is one of the most popular social media platforms, widely used for business promotion, content creation, and personal branding. However, frequent algorithm changes affect the reach of posts, making it harder for creators to plan content strategies.

This project uses Data Science & Machine Learning to analyze Instagram reach data and predict post impressions. By applying multiple regression models and performing hyperparameter tuning, we significantly improved prediction accuracy.

 Results

 Before Hyperparameter Tuning
	â€¢	RÂ² Score: 0.4945
	â€¢	RMSE: 4430.86
	â€¢	Mean CV Score: 0.6963

 After Hyperparameter Tuning
	â€¢	Best CV Score: 0.7718
